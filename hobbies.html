    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
    <p>Hey there!  Let's talk about the things I love to do!</p>
    
    <h2>Cooking</h2>
    <p>I really enjoy making good food.  I have to cook a lot because my family and I are intolerant to so many foods, but I still find it satisfying.</p>
    <h3>What I love about cooking</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Being up and moving around my kitchen</li>
        <li>Baking breads can be so therapeutic</li>
        <li>Finding a new recipe that my son loves</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Graphic Design</h2>
    <p>Here I really am a hobbiest, but I enjoy exercising the creative part of my brain.</p>
    <h3>What I enjoy creating</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>T-shirt designs!  My favorite project so far has been my<a href="https://www.kittl.com/share/clh81jouk06kq1yv0c06agk6y"> day of the week shirts </a>I designed for my son.  I mainly use a website called <a href="https://www.kittl.com">Kittl </a>to make my designs.</li>
        <li>Greeting Cards!  I enjoy making handmade greeting cards for my friends and relatives.  I either purchase or create my own designs and then cut them out on my Silhouette Machine.</li>
        <li>Websites!  While I'm still very much a novice here, I so enjoy the process of turning code into something beautiful.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Photography</h2>
    <p>While my main subject has grown beyond being willing, I still enjoy taking pictures.  I took pictures for my son's school for many years, and I loved capturing the faces and special moments of the students.</p>
